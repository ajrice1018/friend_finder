# friend_finder Application
Express.js website to find and compare most compatible friends

## How it works
The app is a 10 question quiz based around a 1(Strongly Disagree)-5(Strongly Agree) to match most compatible friends. When the responses are taken in the app performs a calculation on the input and then finds the most comparable friend and matches them.

You can find a heroku demo version of the app deployed [here](https://andy-app-homework.herokuapp.com/).
